This is a sketch notebook created with kaggle kernels in which I worked on a small research project on the Student Alcohol Consumption dataset.

## Used algorithms

* ElasticNet
* KNN Regression
* SVR (SVM regressor)
* Random Forests Regression

## Main scenarios

* Final grade prediction from semestrial grades
* Final grade prediction from the dataset
* Alcohol consumption impact on grades
